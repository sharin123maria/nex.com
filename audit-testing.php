                            Discovery phase is the initial stage in software development. The main focus is to get to know the end-user, goals & scope, clarify project vision, and identify risks In discovery phase. At NexGenTech, discovery phase is an important part of software development and testing. Our project team researches collect and analyzes project information and with that plan the entire product development cycle.
                            <p>At NextGenTech we believe the discovery phase is necessary to include in the QA because of 5 reasons. To determine the goal, to build product architecture, to mitigate the cost, to identify risks and to create clear roadmap. 
                            To Run a successful audit & discovery phase we first define the TG. After that we do the market analysis and other steps.</p> 
                            <p>Audit in the field of software testing, is defined as the process that is used to evaluate a software. Against established and specified standards and specification a software is evaluated. The basic purpose of audit is to check if the process being implemented is up to the mark.</p>
